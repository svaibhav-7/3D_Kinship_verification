About Kinship
Kinship using facial features refers to identifying or inferring family relationships based on facial resemblance.
Relatives often share similar facial structures (eyes, nose, jawline).
Facial recognition systems can analyze these similarities to predict kinship.
Used in anthropology, genetics, and AI research.
Helpful in missing person identification and family linkage studies
